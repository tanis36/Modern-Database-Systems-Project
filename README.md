# Modern-Database-Systems-Project
A group project for a Modern Database Systems class.

To get started, have POSTGRES installed, and the extensions for Vscode. Then, using these extensions, using the command line use add a connection with the hostname "localhost",
and the authentication user as "postgres". then, enter any password you would like, keep the port number the same, and use a Standard Connection. Finally, enter "localhost" 
once again as the database to connect to and everything should be able to operate properly.

NOTE: After a query is run, right-click on the database under the Elephant Icon in Vscode. Then, click refresh, and everything should populate depending on the queries you run.
  
Below is a list of the files as well as what they are used for.

ER Diagram.png: A picture displaying the ER-Diagram we used to plan the database

Schema.png: The Relationship Schema we implemented as our database. Underlines are for primary keys, asterisk are for foreign keys

create-tables.sql: The create-tables.sql file is a query that creates the tables needed to create our database.

insert-data.sql: The insert-data.sql file is a query that inserts sample data that can be used with each of the queries.

quwie-#.sql: All of the files titled "quwie" are all sample queries. Make sure to create the tables and insert the data before running these.
